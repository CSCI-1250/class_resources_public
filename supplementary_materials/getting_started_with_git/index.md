# Get Started with Git and GitHub

## Why Source Control?

Imagine accidentally deleting hours of work, or needing to undo changes you made three days ago, or collaborating on a project where everyone's edits overwrite each other's. Frustrating, right?

**Source control** (also called version control) solves these problems. It's like a time machine for your code—tracking every change, letting you rewind to any previous version, and enabling seamless collaboration. Git is the industry-standard tool for this, and GitHub is where developers showcase their work, contribute to open-source projects, and build a portfolio that speaks louder than any resume.

Bottom line: **Every professional developer uses source control.** Learning it now means you'll breeze through future coursework and internships while others struggle to catch up.

## Let's Get Started

### 1. Install Git

- **Windows users**: Install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (includes a Linux-like terminal that works beautifully)
- **Mac/Linux users**: Git likely comes pre-installed, but you can download it from the same link

### 2. Dive In!

Work through the [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) (start with "Getting Started" and "Collaborating"). These are fast-paced, practical, and excellent. Trust me—the time you invest now will pay dividends later:

- **In CSCI-1260**: Push your changes to GitHub at the end of class, then pull them down at home to keep working. No more losing work on a flash drive or fighting OneDrive for your own IDE to have permission to read from, or write to, a OneDrive location.
- **In Software Engineering**: While other teams panic over merge conflicts because they didn't set up a proper `.gitignore` file (and committed all their build artifacts), you'll be calmly managing branches like a pro.

**Your future self will thank you. Let's git started!**
