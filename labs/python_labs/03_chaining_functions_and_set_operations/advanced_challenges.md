# Challenge 1: Complete Email Security Manager (35 minutes)

## Building a Production-Ready Security System

Now we'll combine everything: functions working in sequence AND set operations to build a comprehensive email security manager that could actually be used in a real IT environment.

### Challenge 1A: Email Security Manager
Create a new file: `email_security_manager.py`

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Your Task**:
1. Run the program with different security levels and compare the results
2. Add some domains from Ryan's original list to `incoming_emails` and test
3. Modify the `risk_keywords` list and see how it affects scoring

# Challenge 2: Smart Blocklist Updater (40 minutes)

## Advanced Set Operations for Threat Intelligence

Design a system that automatically updates your blocklists based on multiple intelligence sources while avoiding false positives.
